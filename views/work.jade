      p At Goodybag, we installed some speakers around
        | the office. First, we hooked up the speakers to
        | someone's laptop and played their playlist. This got 
        | old quickly.
      p I decided to democratize our music and built Discoteca
        | which allows people to search for tracks and queue
        | them. The playlist gets updated in real-time and 
        | shows album art as well as track information.

      p Dataclips is like a sql pastebin that creates public,
        | anonymized links to query results in a neatly
        | formatted table.
      p The current implementation supports Postgres servers
        | and versioning your data clips. The next steps will
        | be adding integrations so that you can create dataclips
        | through IDEs and chat services like Slack and Hipchat.
